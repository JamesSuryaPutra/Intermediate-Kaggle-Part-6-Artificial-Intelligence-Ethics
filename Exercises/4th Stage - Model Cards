<Scenario A>
You are the creator of the Simple Zoom video editing tool, which uses AI to automatically zoom the video camera in on a presenter as they walk across a room during a presentation. You are
launching the Simple Zoom tool and releasing a model card along with the tool, in the interest of transparency.

-Audience-
Which audiences should you write the model card for? Once you have thought about your answer, check it against the solution below.

Solution:
Model cards should be written for the groups that are most likely to read it. For Simple Zoom, such groups probably include people using the tool to record videos, organizations seeking to
adopt the tool, IT and audio-visual teams and agencies, computer vision researchers, policymakers and developers of similar AI systems. Given how broad this group is, your team can only
assume a basic knowledge of video recording terms throughout the model card.
****************

<Scenario B>
You are the product manager for Presenter Pro, a popular video and audio recording product for people delivering talks and presentations. As a new feature based on customer demand, your
team has been planning to add the AI-powered ability for a single video camera to automatically track a presenter, focusing on them as they walk across the room or stage, zooming in and
out automatically and continuously adjusting lighting and focus within the video frame.

You are hoping to incorporate a different company’s AI tool (called Simple Zoom) into your product (Presenter Pro). To determine whether Simple Zoom is a good fit for Presenter Pro, you
are reviewing Simple Zoom’s model card.

-Intended Use-
The Intended Use section of the model card includes the following bullets:
1} Simple Zoom is intended to be used for automatic zoom, focus, and lighting adjustment in the real-time video recording of individual presenters by a single camera.
2} Simple Zoom is not suitable for presentations in which there is more than one presenter or for presentations in which the presenter is partially or fully hidden at any time.

As a member of the team evaluating Simple Zoom for potential integration into Presenter Pro, you are aware that Presenter Pro only supports one presenter per video. However, you are also
aware that in some Presenter Pro customers use large props in their presentation videos. Given the information in the Intended Use section of the model card, what problem do you foresee
for these customers if you integrate Simple Zoom into Presenter Pro? What are some ways in which you could address this issue?

Hint:
There is a risk that the large props could partially or fully hide the presenter.

Solution:
Since Simple Zoom is not suitable for presentations in which the presenter is partially or fully hidden at any time, it might not work well in a presentation in which the presenter uses
a large object, because the object could partially or fully hide the presenter. There are many potential ways to address this issue. For example, your team could reach out to the Simple
Zoom team to assess the potential risks and harms of using Simple Zoom with props. As another example, your team could eventually add a message in the Presenter Pro user interface
explaining that the Simple Zoom feature should not be used in presentations that use props.

-Factors, evaluation data, metrics & quantitative analysis-
We'll continue with Scenario B, where you are the product manager for Presenter Pro. Four more sections of the model card for Simple Zoom are described below.

Factors: The model card lists the following factors as potentially relevant to model performance:
- Group factors
  - Self-reported gender
  - Skin tone
  - Self-reported age
- Other factors
  - Camera angle
  - Presenter distance from camera
  - Camera type
  - Lighting

Evaluation data:
To generate the performance metrics reported in the Quantitative Analysis section (discussed below), the Simple Zoom team used an evaluation data set of 500 presentation videos, each
between two and five minutes long. The videos included both regular and unusual presentation and recording scenarios and included presenters from various demographic backgrounds.

Metrics:
Since Simple Zoom model performance is subjective (involving questions like whether a zoom is of appropriate speed or smoothness; or whether a lighting adjustment is well-executed), the
Simple Zoom team tested the tool’s performance by asking a diverse viewer group to view _Simple Zoom_’s output videos (using the evaluation dataset’s 500 videos as inputs). Each viewer
was asked to rate the quality of video editing for each video on a scale of 1 to 10, and each video’s average rating was used as a proxy for _Simple Zoom_’s performance on that video.

Quantitative analysis:
The quantitative analysis section of the model card includes a brief summary of performance results. According to the summary, the model generally performs equally well across all the
listed demographic groups (gender, skin tone and age).

The quantitative analyses section also includes interactive graphs, which allow you to view the performance of the Simple Zoom tool by each factor and by intersections of ‘Group’ and
‘Other’ factors. As a member of the team evaluating Simple Zoom for potential integration into Presenter Pro, what are some questions you might be interested in answering and exploring
via the interactive graphs?

q_3.check()

Solution:
There are many possible answers to this question. For example, you may want to check that the model’s equal performance across demographic groups (gender, skin tone and age) remains
equal across different camera angles, distances from camera, camera types and lighting conditions. As another example, you may want to know how well the model performs from the specific
camera angles that Production Pro customers most commonly use.
